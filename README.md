# UK Road Accidents Dashboard in Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize UK road accident data. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of road safety metrics, enabling users to explore accident trends, contributing factors, and casualty distributions interactively. 

## Project Overview

The UK Road Accidents Dashboard is a single-page interactive dashboard built with Power BI. It provides detailed insights into road accidents, casualties, and associated factors such as weather conditions, road surface types, and vehicle categories. The dashboard also includes geographic analysis to highlight accident-prone areas and casualty demographics.

### Key Features:
- A single-page dashboard with interactive visualizations.
- Metrics include total accidents, total casualties, fatalities, serious casualties, and slight casualties.
- Detailed insights on fatalities by road type, casualties by weather conditions, road surface, and vehicle type.
- Demographic analysis of casualties through a map, providing geographic and demographic insights.

## Dashboard Highlights

The UK Road Accidents PowerBI dashboard provides an insightful overview of key road safety metrics, allowing users to interact with and analyze UK road accident data. The dashboard is a single-page interactive view that includes various visualizations, each focusing on different aspects of road accidents and casualties. 

Key visualizations include:

- **Accident Overview**: Displays metrics like total accidents, total casualties, and the breakdown of fatalities and injuries across different severity levels.
- **Contributing Factors**: Visualizations show how weather conditions, road surface, and road types contribute to accidents and casualties.
- **Casualty Insights**: Detailed insights into casualties, including their demographic distribution and vehicle types involved in accidents.
- **Geographic Analysis**: A map-based visualization helps identify accident-prone areas and visualize casualty data by geographic location.

These visualizations together allow for a comprehensive exploration of road accident trends, helping users understand the impact of various factors on road safety in the UK.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains detailed information about road accidents in the UK, including accident locations, severity, contributing factors, and casualties. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: [UK Road Safety, Accidents, and Vehicles Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles)

The dataset includes:
- **Accident Information**: Data on the location, date, and time of accidents, as well as their severity.
- **Casualty Information**: Data on casualties, including the type of injury (fatal, serious, slight).
- **Contributing Factors**: Weather conditions, road types, and other contributing factors such as road surface conditions and vehicle types.
- **Geospatial Data**: Geographic coordinates for accident locations to provide a map-based view of casualty distribution.

## Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

- **Current Year Casualties**: Displays the total number of casualties for the current year.
- **Current Year Accidents**: Shows the total number of road accidents recorded in the current year.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Highlights the distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicles involved in the accidents.
- **Year-over-Year Comparison**: Provides a comparison of casualties between the current year and the previous year.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Analyzes casualties based on road types (e.g., highways, local streets).
- **Casualties by City/Rural Roads**: Compares casualties occurring in urban versus rural road settings.
- **Casualties by Weather**: Shows how different weather conditions contribute to road accident casualties.

These visualizations offer a holistic view of the data, enabling users to delve deeper into specific aspects of road safety and casualty trends.

## Usage

This dashboard enables users to:
- **Analyze Trends**: Understand accident and casualty trends across the UK.
- **Explore Contributing Factors**: Investigate how factors like weather, road surface, and vehicle type contribute to accidents and casualties.
- **Identify Accident-Prone Areas**: Use the map-based visualizations to identify areas with high accident rates and analyze casualty distributions.
